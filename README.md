## Find flight path between two cities
### Given a starting city and an ending city, wilpython function returns:
* the shortest path between the two cities (including the two cities)
    - the shortest path is based on Dijkstra's algorithm
* the distance traveled between them
* appropriately handles the situation where no path exists

### To run:
```
$python src/flight_paths.py
$path('Moscow', 'London') # => ['Moscow', 'London'] traveled distanse is 1560.2 mi
```
